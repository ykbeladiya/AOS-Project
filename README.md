### Project Overview
This project focuses on **Facial Image Recognition** using a **Distributed Machine Learning** approach. It leverages the power of **rich clients** for improved performance and scalability. The project is designed to demonstrate how distributed computing techniques can be used to train and deploy models efficiently.

### Workflow

### Key Features
- **Facial Recognition**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to identify and verify faces from images.
- **Distributed Machine Learning**: Implements a distributed system where multiple clients work together to process data.
- **Rich Clients**: Ensures the client-side machines handle complex tasks to offload work from central servers, improving scalability.
- **Real-time Processing**: Designed for real-time facial recognition use cases.

### Tech Stack
- **Python**: Core language for implementing the distributed system.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Machine learning library used for building the facial recognition model.
- **streamlit**: A micro web framework for developing the backend.
- **Rich Client Architecture**: Ensures the clients handle substantial processing tasks.
  
### Installation

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow, Keras, and other machine learning dependencies
- streamlit for running the server
- OpenCV for image processing

#### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ykbeladiya/AOS-Project
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd AOS-Project
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
    streamlit run app.py

### Usage
1. Run the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   
2. Access the web app via your browser (Streamlit will provide a local URL, typically [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)).
3. Upload facial images through the interface, and the system will recognize and verify the faces in real-time, demonstrating the distributed machine learning approach.
